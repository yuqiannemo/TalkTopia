# README
Hi, my name is Yu Qian, a current year 1 student in NUS majoring CS.

I developed this TalkTopia website using ruby on rails (Ruby version 3.2.2) as the backend and react.js as the frontend.
Since due to some reason (which I haven't figured out why even though I strictly follow the online tutorials) I cannot successfully deploy my app, here are the nstructions on how to setup my application to facilitate grading:

1. get a copy of the TalkTopia files
2. store them in some folder, e.g: the c drive
3. open git bash and type in "cd/ c/TalkTopia"
4. then type in "rails s"
5. use url localhost:3000 to see the website

maybe the above steps require the installation of certain things. I have included a video showing my website so please take a look.
