# README

Hi, my name is Yu Qian, a current year 1 student in NUS majoring in CS. I developed this TalkTopia website using Ruby on Rails (Ruby version 3.2.2, rails version 7.1.3) as the backend and React.js as the frontend.

The link to my website is http://talktopia.fly.dev

In case the link fails, I have provided an alternatie to set up my application:

1. Get a copy of the TalkTopia files.
2. Store them in a folder, e.g., the C drive.
3. Open Git Bash and navigate to the TalkTopia folder by typing "cd/ c/TalkTopia".
4. Type "rails s" to start the server.
5. Use the URL "localhost:3000" to access the website.

Please note that the above steps may require the installation of certain dependencies. I have included a video in my write-up that showcases my website, so please refer to it for a better understanding.
